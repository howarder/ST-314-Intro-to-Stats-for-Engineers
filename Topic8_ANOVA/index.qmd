### Motivating Exercises

In each of the side-by-side boxplots below, you'll see data sampled from three different populations. The red dot in each plot corresponds to the sample mean.

## Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) {.smaller}

:::{.incremental}
-   An ANOVA is a holistic procedure used to test whether there is evidence that [at least one pair of populations]{.fragment .highlight-red} have different means when comparing more than two populations.

-   Why is it called an *Analysis of **Variance*** if the goal is to compare means?

    -   In an ANOVA, we'll compare the variability *across* groups to the variability *within* groups.

## Notation

-   $k=$ [number of groups (i.e. number of populations of interest)]{.fragment}

-   $n=$ [overall sample size (i.e. size of all samples combined)]{.fragment}

-   $\overline{x}=$ [overall sample mean (i.e. mean of all observations ignoring groups)]{.fragment}

-   $n_i=$ [sample size of the $i$th group]{.fragment}

-   $\mu_i=$ [population mean of the $i$th group]{.fragment}

-   $\overline{x}_i=$ [sample mean of the $i$th group]{.fragment}

-   $s_i=$ [sample standard deviation of the $i$th group]{.fragment}

#### 4. The $F$ test statistic

[In order to answer our question of interest, we must compare the variability between groups to the variability within groups.]{.fragment}

::::::: fragment
:::::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
**Mean Square Between Groups (MSG)**

-   Measures the average variability [between]{style="color:red;"} groups

[$$MSG = \frac{1}{k-1}\sum \limits_{i=1}^k n_i (\overline{x}_i - \overline{x})^2$$]{.fragment}
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
**Mean Square Error (MSE)**

-   Measures the average variability [within]{style="color:red;"} groups

[$$MSE = \frac{1}{n-k}\sum \limits_{i=1}^k (n_i-1)s_i^2 $$]{.fragment}

The test statistic is the ratio of the average between group variability to the average within group variability $$F = \frac{MSG}{MSE}$$

### ANOVA Procedure Steps

#### 5. Determine the Null Distribution

[There are two conditions that need to be met in order to assume the upcoming null distribution:]{.fragment}

::: incremental
1.  The samples sizes must be sufficiently large.

-   If $n_i\geq 30$, we can move forward.

-   If any of the sample sizes are less than 30, we need to look at the sampled distribution(s) of the small sample(s). If there are no clear outliers or strong skewness in the sampled data, we can move forward.

2.  We need to be able to assume constant variance across the groups.

-   To assess this condition, we should use the sampled distributions and make a judgement as to whether the standard deviations are similar between samples.
:::

[If the above conditions are met, under the null hypothesis, the test statistic, $F = \frac{MSG}{MSE}$, follows an [*F* distribution with $k-1$ and $n-k$ degrees of freedom.]{.fragment .highlight-red}]{.fragment}

  geom_area(stat = "function", 
            fun = df,

            fill = "darkgreen", 
            alpha = .5,
            xlim = c(1.5, 6)) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = 1.5, y = 0, xend = 1.5, yend = 0.4), 
               size = 1.5) +

### 8. Make a conclusion

[Write a 2-part conclusion (we'll exclude a single point estimate and confidence interval). The conclusion should be written in the context of the problem and contain the following components:]{.fragment}

1.  A statement for the strength of evidence in favor the alternative hypothesis.

2.  Whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.
