# Collecting Data

## 

### Population

::: fragment
The complete collection of subjects we are interested in learning or making inference about.
:::

::: fragment
**Example:**
:::

 

### Parameter

::: fragment
A characteristic about the population, typically unknown or unobservable.
:::

::: fragment
**Example:**
:::

## 

### Sample

::: fragment
An observed subset of the population
:::

::: fragment
**Example:**
:::

 

### Statistic

::: fragment
A characteristic about the observed sample
:::

::: fragment
**Example:**
:::

## Statistical Inference

::: incremental
-   The process of using known sampled information to form a conclusion about unknown population characteristics.

-   Primarily concerned with understanding and quantifying the uncertainty of parameter estimates (Weeks 4-10).
:::

## Observational Study {.smaller}

. . .

A study that observes and collects information on units but does not attempt to change or influence the units.

. . .

-   **Confounding** [occurs in an observational study when it appears that the outcome of one variable is "causing" the outcome of another.]{.fragment}

 

. . .

## Bias

. . .

The tendency to systematically favor certain parts of a population over others.

. . .

**How can we reduce biases when designing an observational study?**

. . .

Use a random mechanism when sampling from the population.

. . .

-   Simple random sampling
-   Stratified random sampling
-   Cluster random sampling
-   Systematic random sampling

SRS, Strat, Cluster on page 27 of OpenIntro. Systematic in section 1.2 of openstax

:::

## Designed Experiments

. . .

A study in which the observed units are **randomly assigned** to treatments.

. . .

**Example:**

. . .

 

Four principles of a well-designed randomized experient:

1.  Controlling
2.  Randomization
3.  Replication
4.  Blocking

## Design an Observational Study: Part 1 {.smaller}

A very large college class has 600 students. The students are divided into 25 groups, each of 24 students, for lab sections administered by different teaching assistants. The instructor wants to conduct a survey about how satisfied the students are with the course, and she believes that the lab section a student is in might affect the student’s overall satisfaction with the course.

Using one of the sampling schemes discussed in this week's assigned reading, in a few sentences, propose a strategy to sample 100 students from the class so that you have a representative sample of the entire population of interest.

**Sampling Schemes:**

::: non-incremental
-   Simple random sampling
-   Stratified random sampling
-   Cluster random sampling
-   Systematic random sampling

## Design an Observational Study: Part 2

-   Find one or two other students nearby to do this part with.

-   Introduce yourself if you have not already done so.

-   One group member should start by reading their study design aloud to the group.

-   The other group members' task is to determine what sampling scheme was used.

-   Make sure each group member has a chance to share their sampling designs.

## Design an Experiment: Part 1 {.smaller}

A pharmaceutical company is interested in assessing whether taking daily aspirin reduces the risk of heart attack. 1,500 individuals over the age of 55 have agreed to participate in the company’s study. Of the 1,500 participants, 550 report being at-risk for heart disease based on family medical history. The remaining 950 participants report no predisposition to heart disease.

In a few sentences, briefly outline an experimental design that may allow the researchers to answer the question of interest: "Does taking daily aspirin reduce the risk of heart attack?"

Your design should include the four elements of experimental design: controlling, randomization, replication, and blocking.

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 2.5)
```

## Design an Experiment: Part 2

-   Return to your small group

-   In your group, take turns sharing the experimental designs.

-   After each member shares, identify how **controlling, randomization,** and **replication** were implemented in the study.

    -   If one or more these components is missing from the suggested design, discuss how it could be implemented.

# Exploring Data

## Describing Distributions of Quantitative Data

### Center: [Central tendency of the data]{.fragment}

::: fragment
$$ \text{Sample mean: } \overline{x} = \frac{\sum \limits_{i = 1}^n x_i}{n}$$
:::

::: incremental
-   $n$: number of observations

-   $x_i$: $i$th observation in the dataset
:::

## Describing Distributions of Quantitative Data

### Center: Central tendency of the data

[Sample Median, $M$: middle value of the ordered data]{.fragment}

::: incremental
-   If $n$ is odd, $M$, is the middle value in the ordered set of values.

-   If $n$ is even, $M$ is the midpoint (average) of the $\frac{n}{2}$th and $\frac{n}{2}+1$th observation.

## Describing Distributions of Quantitative Data

### Spread: how spread out is the distribution?

Interquartile Range (IQR): [describes the range of the middle 50% of the data]{.fragment}

::: fragment
$$IQR = Q_3 - Q_1$$

$Q_1$ is the first quartile: 25th percentile, the value such that 25% of data fall below this value

$Q_3$ is the third quartile: 75th percentile, the value such that 75% of data fall below this value

### Outliers: [extreme values that fall outside the pattern of the data]{.fragment}

[An observation are considered outliers if it is]{.fragment}

:::: fragment
::: incremental

-   greater than $Q_3 + 1.5 \times IQR$

### Shape: [Overall pattern of the data]{.fragment}
