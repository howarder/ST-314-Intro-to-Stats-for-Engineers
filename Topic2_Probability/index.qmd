An aircraft emergency locator transmitter (ELT) is a device designed to transmit a signal in the case of a crash. Suppose there are only four manufacturers that produce all ELTs. We'll call these manufacturers *Companies W, X, Y,* and *Z*.

Conditional probabilities redefine the sample space to only include outcomes that are in the conditional subset.

## Example {.smaller}

Â 

An aircraft emergency locator transmitter (ELT) is a device designed to transmit a signal in the case of a crash. Suppose there are only four manufacturers that produce all ELTs. We'll call these manufacturers *Companies W, X, Y,* and *Z*.

Â 

|   | Conditional Probabilities |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Of ELTs produced by Company *W*, 2% are defective. | [$P(Def|W) = 0.02$]{.fragment} |
| Of ELTs produced by Company *X*, 2% are defective. | [$P(Def|X) = 0.02$]{.fragment} |
| Of ELTs produced by Company *Y*, 4% are defective. | [$P(Def|Y) = 0.04$]{.fragment} |
| Of ELTs produced by Company *Z*, 6% are defective. | [$P(Def|Z) = 0.06$]{.fragment} |

## General Multiplication Rule

[$P(A \text{ and }B)=$?]{.fragment}

[Recall the definition of a conditional probability:]{.fragment}

::: fragment
$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \text{ and }B)}{P(B)}$
:::

::: fragment
Additionally,

$P(B|A) = \frac{P(A \text{ and }B)}{P(A)}$
:::

::: fragment
Therefore,

[$P(A \text{ and }B)= P(A|B)P(B) = P(B|A)P(A)$]{.fragment .highlight-red}
:::

## Independent Events

[Events are considered **independent** if]{.fragment} [the outcome of one event does not impact the outcome of the other.]{.fragment}

[$P(A|B) = P(A)$ if and only if $A$ and $B$ are independent.]{.fragment} [$P(B|A) = P(B)$ if and only if $A$ and $B$ are independent.]{.fragment}

Â 

[Apply the general multiplication rule to independent events: $P(A \text{ and }B)= P(A|B)P(B) = P(A)P(B)$]{.fragment}

::: {.fragment style="border: 2px solid #2A788EFF; text-align: center"}
**Formal definition of independent events:**

$A$ and $B$ are independent *if and only if* $P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A)\times P(B)$.

Each quadrant of the room has been assigned a company. Based on your assigned company, calculate the probability that the randomly selected ELT is from your company **and** is defective.

| P(W) = 0.6  | P(Def\|W) = 0.02 |
| P(X) = 0.2  | P(Def\|X) = 0.02 |
| P(Y) = 0.15 | P(Def\|Y) = 0.04 |
| P(Z) = 0.05 | P(Def\|Z) = 0.06 |

|                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| P(*W* and Def) = [0.6(0.02) = 0.012]{.fragment}  |
| P(*X* and Def) = [0.2(0.02) = 0.004]{.fragment}  |
| P(*Y* and Def) = [0.15(0.04) = 0.006]{.fragment} |
| P(*Z* and Def) = [0.05(0.06) = 0.003]{.fragment} |
:::
:::::

## Example

|                                     |
|-------------------------------------|
| P(*W* and Def) = 0.6(0.02) = 0.012  |
| P(*X* and Def) = 0.2(0.02) = 0.004  |
| P(*Y* and Def) = 0.15(0.04) = 0.006 |
| P(*Z* and Def) = 0.05(0.06) = 0.003 |

The sum of the four values above yields the probability of what event?

[The probability a randomly selected ELT from any of the four companies is defective, P(Def)]{.fragment style="color:blue;"}

Calculate this probability. [P(Def)=0.012+0.004+0.006+0.003=0.025]{.fragment style="color:blue;"}

## Law of Total Probability

[The marginal probability of event $A$ is equal to the sum of the probabilities of all disjoint events that contain $A$.]{.fragment}

::: fragment
$$P(A) = P(A \text{ and } B_1) + P(A \text{ and } B_2) + ... + P(A \text{ and } B_k)$$

where $B_1, B_2, ..., B_k$ are disjoint events.
:::

Â 

::: fragment
**For example,**

P(Def)=P(W and Def)+P(X and Def)+P(Y and Def)+P(Z and Def)
:::

## Example

Suppose we have randomly selected an ELT and found it to be defective. What is the probability the ELT was produced by company *X*?

Â 

[$P(X|Def)=$$\frac{P(X \text{ and } Def)}{P(W \text{ and } Def) + P(X \text{ and } Def) + P(Y \text{ and } Def) + P(Z \text{ and } Def)}$]{.fragment}

Â 

[$P(X|Def) = \frac{0.004}{0.025}$$=0.16$]{.fragment}

## Bayes' Theorem

[Let $B_1,B_2,...,B_k$ be disjoint events.]{.fragment}

[$P(B_1|A) =$$\frac{P(B_1 \text{ and } A)}{P(A)}$$=\frac{P(A|B_1)P(B_1)}{P(A \text{ and } B_1) + P(A \text{ and } B_2) + ... + P(A \text{ and } B_k)}$$=\frac{P(A|B_1)P(B_1)}{P(A|B_1)P(B_1) + P(A|B_2)P(B_2) +...+ P(A|B_k)P(B_k)}$]{.fragment}

**Bayes Theorem:**

$P(B_1|A) = \frac{P(A|B_1)P(B_1)}{P(A|B_1)P(B_1) + P(A|B_2)P(B_2) +...+ P(A|B_k)P(B_k)}$
