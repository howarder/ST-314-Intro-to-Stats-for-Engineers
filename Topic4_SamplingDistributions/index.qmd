# The Normal Distribution

## Let's start with an example {.smaller}

In a study on driving reaction time, researchers record the time (in seconds) that it takes study participants to react to the brake lights of a vehicle traveling in front of them.

A histogram of the recorded data is shown below.

```{r}

react <- rnorm(505, 1.25, 0.46)
react_df <- data.frame(react)
react_df <- react_df |>
  filter(react > 0)
h <- ggplot(react_df, aes(x = react)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "black", fill = "#D73F09", 
                 breaks = seq(0, max(react_df$react), 
                              length.out = 15)) +

## Example: Driving Reaction Time {.smaller}

The driving reaction time study suggests that reaction times to break lights are Normally distributed with a mean of 1.25 seconds and standard deviation of 0.46.

Consider a driver who reacted in 0.79 seconds. How many standard deviations away from the mean is this driver's reaction time?

# Key Concepts

## Inferential Statistics

::: incremental
-   Recall that inferential statistics use information from a sample to estimate or test characteristics from a population of interest.

-   Typically, we calculate a **point estimate** from the sample as our best guess of the **parameter** of interest.

    -   Naturally, our best guess for the population mean, $\mu$, from a sample is the [sample mean, $\overline{x}$.]{.fragment .fade-in}

    -   Our best guess for the population proportion, $p$, is the [sample proportion, $\hat{p}$.]{.fragment .fade-in}
:::

## Example {.smaller}

As part of a quality control process for computer chips, an engineer at a factory randomly samples 212 chips during a week of production to test the current rate of chips with severe defects. She finds that 27 of the chips are defective.

The information above describes the outcome of a single sample. Suppose the true proportion of defective chips at this factory is $p=0.1$.

## Sampling Distributions

 

#### If we can't observe the sampling distribution in real-world applications, why do we care about it?

 

::: {.fragment style="border: 2px solid #2A788EFF; text-align: center"}
Understanding the sampling distribution of commonly used statistics, such as $\overline{x}$ and $\hat{p}$, allows us to quantify the uncertainty in our point estimates.
:::

<!-- ## Unbiased Estimators -->

<!-- Recall that because of sampling variability, a statistic from a sample is a random variable. -->

<!-- A statistic is called **unbiased** if its expectation is equal to the corresponding population parameter. -->

<!--   -->

<!-- . . . -->

<!-- $\overline{x}$, $\hat{p}$, and $s^2$ are unbiased. -->

<!--   -->

<!-- . . . -->

<!-- $E(\overline{x}) =$ [$\mu$]{.fragment .fade-in} -->

<!-- $E(\hat{p}) =$ [$p$]{.fragment .fade-in} -->

<!-- $E(s^2) =$ [$\sigma^2$]{.fragment .fade-in} -->

<!-- ## Consistent Estimators & The Law of Large Numbers {.smaller} -->

<!-- A point estimate is called **consistent** if it converges in probability to its corresponding population parameter. -->

<!--   -->

<!-- Under the Law of Large Numbers, we have that as sample size, $n$, increases the point estimate will approach the population parameter. -->

<!-- . . . -->

<!--   -->

<!-- $\overline{x}$, $\hat{p}$, and $s^2$ are consistent. -->

<!-- . . . -->

<!-- Therefore, as $n$ increases towards the size of the population -->

<!-- $\overline{x} \rightarrow$ [$\mu$]{.fragment .fade-in} -->

<!-- $\hat{p} \rightarrow$ [$p$]{.fragment .fade-in} -->

<!-- $s^2 \rightarrow$ [$\sigma^2$]{.fragment .fade-in} -->

## Sample Size & Sampling Variability {.smaller}

![](samp_size.png)

::: {incremental}
-   The variability of the point estimate is called the [standard error]{.fragment .highlight-red}.

-   The standard error is the [standard deviation]{.fragment .highlight-red} of the sampling distribution.

-   As $n$ increases, the standard error of the point estimate decreases.
