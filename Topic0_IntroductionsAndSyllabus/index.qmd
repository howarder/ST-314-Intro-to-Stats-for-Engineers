. . .

-   Everyone is excused from three classes, for any reason. In-class activities will not be excused beyond three absences.

## Communication üó£Ô∏è

## Required Course Materials üìö {.smaller}

-   Top Hat

    -   Starting **Week 2**, you will need a smart phone, laptop, or tablet with you each class.

    -   Top Hat licenses can be purchased from the Beaver Store (link in Syllabus on Canvas).

. . .

-   R **AND** RStudio Statistical Software

    -   R is a free open-source programming language.

    -   RStudio is the integrated development environment (IDE) we'll work in when using R.

    -   Instructions for downloading both are posted in the Start Here module on Canvas.

. . .

-   Word Processor

. . .

-   FREE textbook: OpenIntro Statistics by David Diez, Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel, and Christopher Barr

## Preparing for Class ‚úèÔ∏è {.smaller}

. . .

Before attending our in-person meetings each week, you need to do the following:

-   **Required:** Read the assigned sections from OpenIntro Statistics (or other free resources linked on Canvas).

-   **Required:** Complete the week's pre-lecture activity (due Mondays at 11:59 pm).

-   **Recommended:** take notes as you read and work on the pre-lecture activity

. . .

If you prefer a pre-formatted version of the material we'll cover in class (e.g. slides, example problems), check the canvas module for those documents and download/print them before class.

. . .

**There is an expectation that you will have completed all required readings and pre-lecture assignments before class.**

## Class Meetings üë• {.smaller}

. . .

-   A portion of each class will be spent reviewing concepts from the readings and pre-lecture materials, as well as going over examples when applicable.

. . .

-   Each class, time will also be set aside to complete the in-class activity.

. . .

-   Your 3 lowest in-class activity grades will be dropped.

. . .

-   Occasionally, we will do an R programming demo in class. I will do my best to announce these demos ahead of time so that you can bring a laptop if you choose.

. . .

-   All lectures will be recorded and posted to Canvas. There is no option for remote attendance in this class.

. . .

-   You are strongly encouraged to ask questions throughout class. No need to wait for a good stopping point or the end of class - the sooner you get your questions answered the better.

## Weekly Problem Sets üíª {.smaller}

. . .

-   For additional practice with the concepts covered each week, you'll have a problem set to complete by Wednesday at 11:59 pm.

. . .

-   Problem sets are completed in Top Hat.

. . .

-   Questions are graded for correctness.

. . .

-   You will have three attempts per question.

. . .

-   Collaboration is allowed and encouraged on these assignments, but all work must be your own.

## Data Analyses üìà {.smaller}

. . .

-   Weekly written assignments will be used to apply the material covered in class to real-world problems.

. . .

-   Data Analyses are due every Thursday at 11:59 pm PT.

. . .

-   Data Analyses will require the use of RStudio.

. . .

-   Collaboration is allowed and encouraged on these assignments, but all work must be your own.

. . .

-   Data Analyses must be submitted in Gradescope.

    -   When submitting assignments, you must select the page numbers that correspond to each question. A detailed video on how to correctly submit assignments is available in the Start Here module on Canvas. Assignments that are not submitted correctly will be subject to a point deduction.

## Late Policy ‚è∞

. . .

-   Each student is granted two "no questions asked" 24-hour late submissions on outside of class assignments.

. . .

-   Longer extensions may be granted for extenuating circumstances. Longer extensions are not guaranteed.

. . .

-   **You must submit a late assignment request form for any extension.**

. . .

-   In class activities do not apply.

## Exams üìù

. . .

-   There will be two cumulative exams in this course:

    -   Midterm Exam - May 7 at 7 pm (Tuesday of Week 6)

    -   Final Exam - June 11 at 8 pm (Tuesday of Finals Week)

. . .

-   Exams will be open note; however, no devices are allowed. Any notes you wish to use during the exam must be on paper.

. . .

-   More details will be discussed as we approach the exams.

## Advice from Previous ST 314 Students {.smaller}

. . .

-   "Show up and be **active** in every lecture"

. . .

-   "Finding others to review with can be very useful in understanding the material and catching mistakes, making it much easier to succeed in the class."

. . .

-   "Work on the problems sets and data analyses sooner rather than later. This will reduce stress as you go on with the course."

. . .

-   "I would say to go to class everyday, as this class isn't that hard if you do. Also go to office hours as soon as questions arise."

. . .

-   "Make sure you take good notes and attend as many office hours as you can."

. . .

-   "Every week I would do a quick overview to make sure I understand everything."

## Why Statistics? üìä

Spend the next two minutes discussing the following questions with one or two people around you.

1.  What is the study of statistics?

2.  Where have you seen statistics in your field?

3.  Why is it important for engineers to understand and use statistics?
